### Description

Don't wait for VB7 to start inheriting. Inheritance is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming, and VB6 supports it already (sort of).

The Child Class Builder Utility is a VB6 add-in that will create child-classes from existing ones. Learn interface inheritance, or save yourself hours of mind-numbing hand implementation.

Supports polymorphism to the full extent supported by VB.

Includes a brief article on how Interface Inheritance works.

Looks and feels like the VB6 Class Builder Utility.

Makes hundreds of Julienne fries.
